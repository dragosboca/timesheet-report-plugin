## Quick Setup

### 1. Initial Configuration

1. **Install the plugin** from Community Plugins
2. **Configure basic settings**:
   - Timesheet Folder: `Timesheets` (or your preferred location)
   - Currency Symbol: `$` (or `€`, `£`, etc.)
   - Hours Per Workday: `8` (for utilization calculations)

3. **Set up your project**:
   - Project Name: Your current project/client
   - Project Type: Choose based on your billing model
   - Default Rate: Your standard hourly rate (optional)

### 2. Create Your First Timesheet

Create a file named `2024-03-15.md` in your Timesheets folder:

```markdown
---
hours: 8.5
per-hour: 75
client: Acme Corporation
work-order: Website Redesign
worked: true
---

# Daily Work Log - March 15, 2024

## Tasks Completed
- Implemented new user authentication system
- Fixed responsive design issues on mobile
- Client meeting to review progress

**Total: 8.5 hours @ $75/hour = $637.50**
```

**Important:** The plugin looks for specific frontmatter fields:
- `per-hour`: Your hourly rate (preferred field name)
- `hours`: Total hours worked
- `work-order`: Project identifier
- `client`: Client name
- `worked`: Set to `false` for non-working days

⚠️ **Common Issue:** Make sure to use `per-hour` (not `rate`) as this matches the historical format expected by the plugin.

### 3. View Your Report

1. Click the calendar-clock icon in the ribbon, or
2. Use Command Palette → "Open Timesheet Report"
3. Your data will automatically appear in charts and summaries

## Frontmatter Reference

### What Is Frontmatter?

Frontmatter is the YAML data block at the top of your markdown files (between `---` lines). This is where you put **data that the plugin processes** for calculations, charts, and reports.

### Core Properties

```yaml
---
# REQUIRED: Hours worked that day
hours: 8.5              # Number or string, supports decimals

# OPTIONAL: Billing and project info
per-hour: 75            # Hourly rate (number or string)
client: Acme Corp       # Client name (string)
work-order: Project X   # Project/task identifier (string)
project: Website Redesign # Alternative to work-order

# OPTIONAL: Control processing
worked: true            # Whether to count this day (default: true)
date: 2024-03-15       # Date override (usually auto-detected from filename)

# OPTIONAL: Organization
tags: [consulting, web] # For file organization
---
```

### Property Details

#### Required Properties

**`hours`** - Total hours worked that day
```yaml
hours: 8.5          # Decimal hours
hours: "8.5"        # String format also works
hours: 0            # PTO or non-working day
```

#### Billing Properties

**`per-hour`** - Hourly billing rate
```yaml
per-hour: 75        # Standard rate
per-hour: 125       # Premium rate for this day
per-hour: 0         # Non-billable work
```

**`client`** - Client identifier
```yaml
client: Acme Corp           # Single client
client: "Client with spaces" # Use quotes for spaces
```

**`work-order`** - Project or work order
```yaml
work-order: Website Redesign    # Project name
work-order: WO-2024-001        # Work order number
work-order: "Phase 1: Discovery" # Multi-word with quotes
```

**`project`** - Alternative to work-order
```yaml
project: Mobile App Development
# Use either 'project' or 'work-order', not both
```

#### Control Properties

**`worked`** - Whether this counts as a working day
```yaml
worked: true        # Default: counts toward hours/utilization
worked: false       # PTO, holiday, sick day - excluded from calculations
```

**`date`** - Date override (rarely needed)
```yaml
date: 2024-03-15    # Only needed if filename doesn't contain date
date: 2024-12-25    # Useful for holiday tracking
```

### Data Processing Notes

- **Metadata Cache**: The plugin uses Obsidian's official metadata cache for fast, reliable frontmatter access
- **Type Flexibility**: Numbers can be entered as `8.5` or `"8.5"` - both work
- **Default Values**: If `worked` is omitted, it defaults to `true`
- **Project Identification**: The plugin looks for `work-order` first, then `project`, then `client` for task descriptions

## Report Templates

### What Are Report Templates?

Report templates control the **presentation and formatting** of generated monthly reports. They contain placeholder variables that get replaced with calculated values from your timesheet data.

### Template Location

Templates are stored in your configured "Report Template Folder" (default: `Templates`). Create `.md` files with template placeholders.

### Available Placeholders

#### Project Information
```markdown
{{PROJECT_NAME}}        # From plugin settings
{{PROJECT_TYPE}}        # Display-friendly project type
{{CURRENCY}}           # Currency symbol from settings
```

#### Report Data
```markdown
{{MONTH_YEAR}}         # "March 2024"
{{REPORT_PERIOD}}      # Same as MONTH_YEAR
{{MONTH_HOURS}}        # Total hours from frontmatter
{{TOTAL_VALUE}}        # Calculated revenue (hours × rates)
{{REMAINING_HOURS}}    # Budget hours remaining (budget projects only)
```

#### Date/Time
```markdown
{{GENERATION_DATE}}    # Date report was created
{{CURRENT_YEAR}}       # Current year
{{CURRENT_MONTH}}      # Current month number
{{CURRENT_DATE}}       # Today's date (YYYY-MM-DD)
```

#### Content Insertion
```markdown
{{TABLE_PLACEHOLDER}}  # Where the detailed timesheet table appears
```

### Example Templates

2. **Use the report generator** for each month/period needed
3. **Organize output** in dated subfolders
4. **Review and customize** each report before sending to clients

## Performance & Best Practices

### File Organization

#### Recommended Folder Structure

```
📁 Your Vault/
├── 📁 Timesheets/
│   ├── 📁 2024/
│   │   ├── 📁 01-January/
│   │   ├── 📁 02-February/
│   │   └── 📁 03-March/
│   └── 📁 2023/
│       └── 📁 Archive/
├── 📁 Templates/
│   ├── Monthly Report Template.md
│   └── Client Report Template.md
└── 📁 Reports/
    └── 📁 Timesheet/
        ├── 📁 2024/
        └── 📁 Client Deliverables/
```

#### Timesheet File Naming

**Best practices for timesheet files:**

```
✅ Good naming:
2024-03-15.md
2024-03-15-client-work.md
March-15-2024.md

❌ Avoid:
Work today.md (no date)
timesheet.md (no date)
3-15-24.md (ambiguous format)
```

### Performance Optimization

#### Metadata Cache Benefits

The plugin uses Obsidian's official metadata cache, providing:

- **Fast Startup:** No manual file parsing on load
- **Real-time Updates:** Changes reflected immediately
- **Memory Efficient:** Leverages Obsidian's optimized caching
- **Type Safety:** Proper error handling for malformed frontmatter

#### Optimization Tips

**For Large Vaults:**

1. **Use Date Ranges in Embeds:**
   ```timesheet
   WHERE date BETWEEN "2024-01-01" AND "2024-03-31"
   // More efficient than processing all historical data
   ```

2. **Leverage Compact Views:**
   ```timesheet
   VIEW summary
   SIZE compact
   // Faster rendering for frequently-viewed pages
   ```

3. **Archive Old Data:**
   - Move old timesheet files to Archive subfolders
   - Plugin still processes them but with better organization

**For Many Embeds:**

1. **Limit Concurrent Embeds** on single pages
2. **Use Specific Filters** rather than broad date ranges
3. **Consider Separate Pages** for different time periods

### Memory Management

#### Understanding Resource Usage

The plugin is optimized for efficiency:

```javascript
// Memory usage is minimal due to:
- Metadata cache utilization (no duplicate file reading)
- Lazy chart rendering (charts load only when visible)  
- Efficient data structures (time entries cached intelligently)
- Smart query processing (filters applied early to reduce data set)
```

#### Monitoring Performance

Enable **Debug Mode** in settings to monitor:
- File processing times
- Query execution duration
- Memory allocation patterns
- Cache hit/miss ratios

## Troubleshooting

### Data Issues

#### No Timesheet Data Appearing

**Symptoms:** Empty reports, "No data found" messages

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Folder Path:**
   ```
   ✅ Settings → Timesheet Folder: "Timesheets"
   ✅ Verify folder exists in your vault
   ✅ Check for typos in folder name
   ```

2. **Verify File Format:**
   ```yaml
   ✅ Frontmatter present:
   ---
   hours: 8.5
   ---
   
   ❌ Missing frontmatter:
   # Just content without YAML block
   ```

3. **Check Date Detection:**
   ```
   ✅ Filename includes date: "2024-03-15.md"
   ✅ Or frontmatter has date: "date: 2024-03-15"
   ❌ No date information available
   ```

#### Incorrect Calculations

**Symptoms:** Wrong hour totals, missing revenue calculations

**Solutions:**

1. **Validate Frontmatter Types:**
   ```yaml
   ✅ Correct:
   hours: 8.5
   per-hour: 75
   
   ❌ Problematic:
   hours: "eight and a half"
   per-hour: "seventy-five dollars"
   ```

2. **Check Working Day Flags:**
   ```yaml
   ✅ For working days:
   worked: true     # or omit entirely
   
   ✅ For PTO/holidays:
   worked: false
   hours: 0
   ```

3. **Enable Debug Mode:**
   - Go to Settings → Debug Mode: ON
   - Check console for processing details
   - Look for frontmatter parsing messages

#### Date Extraction Problems

**Symptoms:** Files not appearing in correct time periods

**Debug Steps:**

1. **Check Filename Formats:**
   ```
   ✅ Supported formats:
   2024-03-15.md
   March-15-2024.md  
   20240315.md
   
   ❌ Unsupported:
   3/15/24.md
   Mar 15.md
   Tuesday.md
   ```

2. **Verify Frontmatter Dates:**
   ```yaml
   ✅ Correct format:
   date: 2024-03-15
   
   ❌ Incorrect formats:
   date: "March 15, 2024"
   date: "3/15/24"
   date: 15-03-2024
   ```

3. **Debug Date Extraction:**
   - Enable Debug Mode
   - Look for "Date extracted: YYYY-MM-DD" messages
   - Check "Could not extract date" warnings

### Template Issues

#### Template Not Loading

**Symptoms:** Generated reports use default template instead of custom template

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify Template Path:**
   ```
   ✅ Settings → Report Template Folder: "Templates"
   ✅ Settings → Default Report Template: "Templates/My Template.md"
   ✅ File exists at specified path
   ```

2. **Check File Permissions:**
   ```
   ✅ Template file is readable
   ✅ Template folder is accessible
   ✅ No file locks or permissions issues
   ```

3. **Validate Template Content:**
   ```markdown
   ✅ Must contain:
   {{TABLE_PLACEHOLDER}}
   
   ✅ Valid placeholders:
   {{MONTH_YEAR}}
   {{MONTH_HOURS}}
   {{PROJECT_NAME}}
   
   ❌ Invalid placeholders:
   {MONTH_YEAR}     // Single braces
   [[MONTH_YEAR]]   // Wiki links
   ```

#### Missing Placeholder Replacement

**Symptoms:** Generated reports show `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` instead of values

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Placeholder Spelling:**
   ```markdown
   ✅ Correct:
   {{MONTH_HOURS}}
   {{TOTAL_VALUE}}
   
   ❌ Incorrect:
   {{MONTHLY_HOURS}}    // Wrong name
   {{TOTAL_VALUE }}     // Extra space
   {{ MONTH_HOURS}}     // Extra space
   ```

2. **Verify Data Availability:**
   ```
   ✅ For {{REMAINING_HOURS}}:
   - Project Type must be "Fixed Hour Budget" or "Retainer"
   - Budget Hours must be set in project settings
   
   ✅ For {{TOTAL_VALUE}}:
   - Default Rate must be set, OR
   - Timesheet files must have per-hour rates
   ```

### Query Syntax Issues

#### Embedding Syntax Errors

**Symptoms:** Query blocks show errors instead of data

**Common Issues & Fixes:**

1. **Case Sensitivity:**
   ```
   ✅ Correct:
   WHERE year = 2024
   VIEW summary
   CHART trend
   
   ❌ Incorrect:
   where year = 2024    // lowercase
   view summary         // lowercase
   chart trend          // lowercase
   ```

2. **String Quoting:**
   ```
   ✅ Correct:
   WHERE client = "Acme Corp"
   WHERE project = "Web Development"
   
   ❌ Incorrect:
   WHERE client = Acme Corp      // No quotes
   WHERE project = 'Web Dev'     // Single quotes
   ```

3. **Date Format:**
   ```
   ✅ Correct:
   WHERE date BETWEEN "2024-01-01" AND "2024-03-31"
   
   ❌ Incorrect:
   WHERE date BETWEEN 2024-01-01 AND 2024-03-31   // No quotes
   WHERE date BETWEEN "1/1/24" AND "3/31/24"       // Wrong format
   ```

#### Query Performance Issues

**Symptoms:** Slow-loading embeds, timeout errors

**Optimization Strategies:**

1. **Use Specific Date Ranges:**
   ```
   ✅ Fast:
   WHERE year = 2024 AND month = 3
   WHERE date BETWEEN "2024-01-01" AND "2024-03-31"
   
   ❌ Slow:
   WHERE year >= 2020    // Too broad
   // No date filter     // Processes all data
   ```

2. **Choose Appropriate Views:**
   ```
   ✅ For quick checks:
   VIEW summary
   SIZE compact
   
   ✅ For detailed analysis:
   VIEW full
   SIZE detailed
   ```

### Debug Mode Analysis

#### Enabling Debug Mode

1. Go to Settings → Timesheet Report
2. Enable "Debug Mode"
3. Refresh your timesheet view
4. Check browser console (F12 → Console tab)

#### Understanding Debug Output

**File Processing Messages:**
```javascript
[Timesheet Plugin] Processing file: Timesheets/2024-03-15.md
[Timesheet Plugin] Frontmatter found: {hours: 8.5, client: "Acme"}
[Timesheet Plugin] Date extracted: 2024-03-15T00:00:00.000Z
[Timesheet Plugin] Entry added: 8.5 hours for Acme on 2024-03-15
```

**Error Messages:**
```javascript
[Timesheet Plugin] Warning: No frontmatter found in file: Timesheets/notes.md
[Timesheet Plugin] Error: Could not extract date from file: Timesheets/random-note.md
[Timesheet Plugin] Warning: Invalid hours value in file: Timesheets/2024-03-16.md
```

**Performance Metrics:**
```javascript
[Timesheet Plugin] Performance: 
  - Files processed: 45
  - Entries extracted: 32
  - Processing time: 156ms
  - Cache hits: 28
```

#### Using Debug Information

**For Data Issues:**
1. Look for "No frontmatter" warnings → Add YAML blocks
2. Check "Invalid date" errors → Fix filename or add date property
3. Watch "Invalid hours" warnings → Fix numeric format in frontmatter

**For Performance:**
1. Monitor processing time → Consider archiving old files
2. Check cache hit ratio → Restart Obsidian if cache is cold
3. Count processed files → Use date filters in embeds if too many
